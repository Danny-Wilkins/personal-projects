Fire Emblem

This is my personal rendition of the game Fire Emblem.

Contains a parser for the html file saved from this webpage: http://serenesforest.net/blazing-sword/classes/base-stats/

Parser should work with other html files from Serene's Forest such as this one: http://serenesforest.net/the-sacred-stones/classes/base-stats/

Also contains the actual game which isn't quite a game yet. It's getting there.
