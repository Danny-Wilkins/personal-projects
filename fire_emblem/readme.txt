Fire Emblem

This is my personal rendition of the game Fire Emblem.

Contains a parser for the html file saved from this webpage: http://serenesforest.net/blazing-sword/classes/base-stats/

Parser should work with other html files from Serene's Forest such as this one: http://serenesforest.net/the-sacred-stones/classes/base-stats/

Also contains the actual game which isn't quite a game yet. It's getting there.

Current functionality of game:
Generate units from text file
Display units
Commands
Units fighting each other
Unit levelling
Basic map functionality (create, display, move units on map)

Future functionality:
Unit death
Hit chance and other RNG based things
Other basic things
User interaction
Phases and user input (like actually playing the game)

One day:
Add terrain and all that other stuff the game has
